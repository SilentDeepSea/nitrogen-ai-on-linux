Color Inversion: Ensure game_env.py uses the BGRX to RGB conversion, otherwise the AI will be "colorblind."

    Window Focus: The SuperTux window must be the active window for virtual inputs to register.

    Aspect Ratio: Running the game at 1280x720 (16:9) provides the best results for the Vision Transformer model.

## 2. GitHub File Structure Improvements
Looking at your file list in the screenshot:
* **Add a `.gitignore`**: Create a file named `.gitignore` and add `venv/` to it. You don't want to upload your 500MB virtual environment to GitHub.
* **Add `requirements.txt`**: Create a file named `requirements.txt` so you can reinstall everything with one command later:
  ```text
  mss
  vgamepad
  pywinctl
  pillow
  psutil
  gymnasium

3. The Final Patch

Make sure the game_env.py you uploaded contains the pause() and unpause() placeholders we added earlier. Without those, the play.py script will crash immediately when it tries to start the session.
